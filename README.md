Minimum requirements:

1. Create dictionaries to store words and expression in English and one or more languages of your 
choice.
2. Provide functions to save your dictionaries to files and to load them from files.
3. Complete individual words and expression when the user provide only the beginning of a word, 
expression or sentence. When multiple completions are possible, a limited set of them should be 
offered.
4. Provide an option to load a text file containing the beginning of words, expressions and sentences
and output the completion time in words per second. 
a. As part of this requirement, you must include a large (> 5000 word) test text file. This needs 
to be part of your submission so that we can evaluate the performance and quality of your 
text completion.
5. Provide a setting, that when enabled, allows users to add new words or expression to the 
dictionaries when your program cannot find any completion. Note that this should be an option 
that the user can turn on or off.
6. Provide an option to remove a word or phrase from the dictionaries.
7. Provide an option to display the dictionaries.
8. Provide your final program as a standalone java program with user instructions to enable it to be 
run outside the IDE.
9. You will be given additional credit for any other reasonable extensions to your text prediction, for 
example:
  a. A Graphical User Interface
  b. Support for dynamic choice between languages or number of completions offered.
  c. Any techniques to improve the quality of the prediction such as ways to handle grammar.
  d. Any other sensible addition. Please ask if you are unsure.
